To run, type 'make' on the terminal.

For running type ./2 and you will get the result on the screen.


Okay, so this game is about collecting the green and red spiders in their respective baskets and shooting the blue ones.
But  beware! If any spider reaches the base, it blocks that area and you lose 5 points. Also, there will be high speed coins
falling towards the base. Shoot those coins for bonus points!!!

In order to move the green basket, type 'g' and use the arrow keys for motion or the mouse. Similarly, use 'r' for the red
basket and 'b' for the gun. A plus point of the gun is you can rotate it. Any spider collected in the wrong basket or shot 
if not a blue spider will give u a negative point!

If at any time you want to quit the game, press 'q' or 'Esc'. If a spider lands on your gun, GAME OVER!
